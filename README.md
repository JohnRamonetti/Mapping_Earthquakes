# Mapping_Earthquakes

## OVERVIEW
### Purpose: The purpose of the current project was to create interactive maps to display recent earthquake activity and intensity. Base maps have been created for "street", "satellite" and "dark" views.  Layers have been created for recent earthquake activity around the world, with pop-ups to identify location and magnitude of earthquakes.  Users can choose to view 1) all earthquakes within the last week, 2) only major earthquakes (magnitude 4.5 and above) in the last week, and/or 3) tectonic plates (the lines showing various fault lines around the world).  In addition, earthquake markers have been color-coded by magnitude, and the radius of the markers (circles) also correlate to earthquake magnitude.
